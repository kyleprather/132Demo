Mosey
O Mosey

You are truly
The greatest dog

Your breath
is hot
and stinky

Get off my bed
Your paws
are wet

Okay fine, you can stay

Honey Butter
is as beautiful
as a bear rug
in the sun
on a cold
winter day

Her fur is long
and luxurious
May she live forever

Pets are great
but somewhat expensive
